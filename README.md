# Basic C2 Server in flask. 

Basic C2 using flask. Features sqlite database, fully functioning (yet ugly) web front-end, and methods to handle tasks from zombies or admins.

## TODO:
    - Build out beacon to be more feature rich. 
        - download files from server
            - save files to disk on victim host
    - Build out logging system to debug app while running
        - convert all print statements to be logged based on log level
        - configure logging level
    - Rebuild horrendous front end
